I am a technical leader with proven experience in defining technical strategy, architecture, and leading teams. Today at Jellyvision I lead an architecture team that spans the engineering organization. I am setting technical strategy and vision while maintaining alignment between engineering and product.

My background is in software engineering where I have spent years working in and around web applications. I have considerable experience with Ruby on Rails, doing both general application development along with deeper work in refactoring and application performance. That said I've also worked down at the firmware level, while developing security enhancements for Android platforms and even done devops and systems administration for remote mission critical systems.

When I'm away from computers I've been known to climb rocks, race cars, and read books.

I'm based in Philadelphia and I'm always interested in getting involved in the local software development community. <a href="/contact">Contact me</a> if you'd like to chat!
