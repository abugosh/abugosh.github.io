I'm a Director of Architecture with 17+ years building and leading technical teams. I specialize in translating complex technical problems into business value - building AI-powered products, integrating acquisitions, designing scalable platforms. I thrive on "other duties as assigned" - the hard problems others avoid.

My background spans from firmware (Android boot security) to enterprise architecture. I've written code that runs before the OS boots and code that runs in browsers. These days I'm building AI capabilities into enterprise software - chat experiences for end users and document processing tools to simplify complex implementations.

When I'm away from computers I've been known to climb rocks, race cars, and read books.

I'm based in Philadelphia and always interested in connecting with the local tech community. [Contact me](/contact) if you'd like to chat!
