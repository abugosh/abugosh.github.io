<div class="row">
  <p>Director of Architecture with 17+ years building and leading technical teams. Evolved from full-stack engineer in defense contracting to enterprise architect leading platform transformations. My sweet spot is translating complex technical problems into business value: building AI-powered products, integrating acquisitions, designing scalable architectures. I thrive on "other duties as assigned" — the hard problems others avoid.</p>
